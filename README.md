# Movie Night Options! - A Project Using React-Redux with Sagas

## Description

The intension of this project was to create a full stack application utilizing the modern technologies learned at Prime Academy as demonstrated by a rendering of a simple database with movie poster images, movie titles, descriptions, and genres. When fully functional, the user will be able to click on a poster and experience the detail view the individual movie description along with any associated movie genres. The user may navigate to an edit page and make changes to the title and description of the movie, or cancel and return to the main list. The data is maintained in an SQL database with separate tables for movies and genres, and a joined table so data related to a specific movie can be displayed.
